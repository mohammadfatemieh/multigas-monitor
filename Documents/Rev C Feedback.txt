- [DONE] power rail for 12V to clean/filter - adjust output voltage via divider
- [DONE] Battery monitor (voltage divider) - added resistors but unconnected
- [DONE] extra connectors: each electrochem sensor should have it's own dedicated connector
	- 2x 4pin connectors
		- Data + GND + GND + Power (12V) 
	- 4x 2pin connectors
		- Power (12V) + Data
- [DONE] Remove  GPS and BME headers
- [DONE] R200+R203 need to be removed
- [DONE] Remap the alphasense 
- [DONE] Fix SD card signal lines
- [DONE] lower amplifier power rails to 3v3
- [DONE] add PWM pump drive circuit to main PCB
- [DONE] connector for PWM pump
- [DONE] 12V high side switch enable connected to 12V - change to pulldown resistor so that default state is off.
- [DONE] Add more phoenix connectors for each battery so we can power with up to 3 batteries
- [DONE] Add diodes + chokes for battery inputs
- [DONE] IO34, 35, 36, 39 are inputs only - label as such on the datasheet AND make a note on the schematic
- [DONE]connect the alphasense inputs to these since they only need to read the sensor voltage

- [DONE] ALPHS2 TP
- [DONE] ALPHS6 TP
- [DONE] ALPHS7 TP
- [DONE] ALPHS8 TP
- [DONE] ALPHS3 TP
- [DONE] ALPHS4 TP
- [DONE] Abundant GND testpoints

TODO: 
- purchase coin cell (look for "For use with" when you search digikey part of coin cell connector)
- appropriate clips for battery - spade terminals: https://www.mouser.ca/Connectors/Terminals/250-FASTON-Series/_/N-5g5u?P=1z0yy6bZ1yroslpZ1ywwwf6Z1z0wx5rZ1z0jmic&Keyword=AMP+Faston+Terminals&FS=True
- test active current
- Mechanical mounting
- cable assemblies (order with BOM)


software:
- GPS timing issue
- download SD file over wifi
- Figure out how to detect if helicopter is flying over
