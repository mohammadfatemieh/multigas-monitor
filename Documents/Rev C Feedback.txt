- [DONE] power rail for 12V to clean/filter - adjust output voltage via divider
- [DONE] Battery monitor (voltage divider) - added resistors but unconnected
- [DONE] extra connectors: each electrochem sensor should have it's own dedicated connector
	- 2x 4pin connectors
		- Data + GND + GND + Power (12V) 
	- 4x 2pin connectors
		- Power (12V) + Data
- [DONE] Remove  GPS and BME headers
- [DONE] R200+R203 need to be removed
- [DONE] Remap the alphasense 
- [DONE] Fix SD card signal lines
- [DONE] lower amplifier power rails to 3v3
- [DONE] add PWM pump drive circuit to main PCB
- [DONE] connector for PWM pump
- [DONE] 12V high side switch enable connected to 12V - change to pulldown resistor so that default state is off.
- [DONE] Add more phoenix connectors for each battery so we can power with up to 3 batteries
- [DONE] Add diodes + chokes for battery inputs
- [DONE] IO34, 35, 36, 39 are inputs only - label as such on the datasheet AND make a note on the schematic
- [DONE]connect the alphasense inputs to these since they only need to read the sensor voltage
- [DONE] Change Alphasense 12V power LED color 
- [DONE] Ferrite bead for pump 12V
- [DONE] Add GPS component outline on top overlay for placement
- Add thermal vias to GND pads of ICs
- Testpoints for pump drive
- [DONE] Fix amplifier part numbering
- Check LED resistor values
- new part numbers for LED resistors

Passive current draw: 60
Active current draw: ??

For Rev D:
Add silkscreen labels:
- PWR, GND, and DAT for all Alphasense connectors
- PWR, GND for batt in
- all test points


TODO: 
- test coin cell
- appropriate clips for battery - those flat fork shaped ones
