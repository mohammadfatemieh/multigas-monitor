- power rail for 12V to clean/filter
- Battery monitor (voltage divider)
- extra connector: each electrochem sensor should have it's own dedicated connector
	- 2x 4pin connectors
		- Data + GND + GND + Power (12V) 
	- 4x 2pin connectors
		- Power (12V) + Data
- [KEEP] Remove  GPS and BME headers
- see FW troubleshooting doc, R200+R203 need to be removed
- Remap the alphasense 
- Fix SD card signal lines
- [DONE] lower amplifier power rails to 3v3
- appropriate clips for battery - those flat fork shaped ones
- add PWM pump drive circuit to main PCB
- coin cell test
- 12V high side switch enable connected to 12V - change to pulldown resistor so that default state is off.
- Add ring terminals so we can power with up to 3 batteries
- IO34, 35, 36, 39 are inputs only - label as such on the datasheet AND make a note on the schematic
	- connect the alphasense inputs to these since they only need to read the sensor voltage
- Change Alphasense 12V power LED 



Passive current draw: 60 mA
Active current draw: ??

Add silkscreen labels:
- PWR, GND, and DAT for all Alphasense connectors
- PWR, GND for batt in
- coin cell type identifier next to the holder
- all test points
- silkscreen outline for GPS module
